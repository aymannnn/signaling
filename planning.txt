1. We must incorporate variation on:
 
- # programs +/- 1%
- # applicants +/- 10%
- # positions +/- 1%
- IPS gamma distribution with a mean of 12
- # applicants per applicant gamma with a mean of 72

2. Generate constants with WIDE array of gamma distributions to upfront calculate
3. Signals bound from [0 to 30]
4. EACH RANDOMNESS IS FOR EACH SIGNAL AS WELL!!!!!

5. Simplify outputs:

- Reviews per programs
- Unfilled spots (market efficiency)
- # interviews given signal / total # of signals
- # interviews given no signal / total # of non-signals
- # matches from a signal / number of matches 
- 1 - above (for # matches from non-signal)
- decile match: probably flatten into 100 columns (p1a1, p1a2, etc.)
