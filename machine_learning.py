'''
The goal of this file is, out of curiousity, to see what will happen if
we try and train a simple ML model on the simulation data. Perhaps some 
unsupervised learning will reveal some interesting patterns. May also
do a random forest regressor to see what parameters are most important
for predicting outcomes. 

The outcomes we're most interested is best_signal_rpp and best_signal_pigs.
