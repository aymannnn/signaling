1. Need to document the heatmaps and constants generation
2. Need to update the analysis scripts, especially to analyze a single
dataset. (data_analysis.py)
3. Write manuscript
4. Clean up some code that is not really needed, can probably archive the old
simulation.py?
5. Add gamma distribution support to the heatmap?

NOTE: On average, all simulation data is about 50 kb, so about 20,000 
simulations per GB of data to store ALL results.
